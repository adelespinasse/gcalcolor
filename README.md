# GcalColor

This is a browser extension that colors event titles in the new Google Calendar according to your chosen color for each calendar (more like the old Calendar, pre-2018).

It isn't yet in the extension directory for Firefox, but for now you can install it manually.

## Installation

### Chrome

[Install from Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gcalcolor/edegnmdhngniabdiiidplepangdoccna)

## Manual installation

NOTE: With manual installation, the extension will not be automatically updated. You'll need to update it manually to get newer features. Also, if you switch to the version from the Web store, you should uninstall the manually installed version.

### Chrome

Download a zip file of this project by clicking [here](https://github.com/adelespinasse/gcalcolor/archive/master.zip), and unzip the files. Go to `chrome://extensions/`, enable developer mode (checkbox at the top), click "Load unpacked extension...", and select the unzipped directory. Reload your Google Calendar tab.

### Firefox

Download a zip file of this repo by clicking [here](https://github.com/adelespinasse/gcalcolor/archive/master.zip), and unzip the files. Go to `about:debugging` and click "Load Temporary Add-on". Select the `manifest.json` file in the unzipped directory.

### Other browsers

I think this extension should work in most up-to-date desktop browsers (this probably does not include Internet Explorer). I don't know how to install it on anything but Chrome and Firefox. Google it! If you figure it out and want to help, write up the instructions and submit a pull request (or file it as an issue above if you don't know how to do that).
